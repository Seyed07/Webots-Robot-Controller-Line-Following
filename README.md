# Webots-Robot-Controller-Line-Following
This project implements a line-following robot in Webots using three line sensors and two motors. A simple proportional control (PID-like) algorithm adjusts the robotâ€™s movement based on sensor input, ensuring it stays on track by steering toward the center when deviations occur.
